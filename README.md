Description
The AutoNextEpisode plugin for Plex Media Server is designed to automatically advance to the next episode during "Watch Together" sessions and keep playback synchronized across all participants. This ensures a seamless viewing experience for all users, especially during binge-watching sessions.

Installation
1. Download and Extract
Download the AutoNextEpisode.bundle directory and extract it to a location on your computer.
2. Copy to Plex Plugin Directory
Copy the entire AutoNextEpisode.bundle directory into the Plex plugin directory on your Plex Media Server.
Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
macOS/Linux: ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins
3. Configure Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables to configure the plugin:

bash

export PLEX_URL='http://<your-plex-server-ip>:32400'
export PLEX_TOKEN='<your-plex-token>'
export CHECK_INTERVAL=30
Replace <your-plex-server-ip> with the IP address of your Plex server.
Replace <your-plex-token> with your Plex token. You can find your Plex token by following this guide.
4. Restart Plex Media Server
Restart your Plex Media Server to load the new plugin. This will initialize the plugin and start monitoring playback sessions.
Usage
Start playing an episode on Plex and let it run.
The plugin will automatically queue the next episode as the current one approaches its end (less than 2 minutes remaining) and will synchronize playback across all participants in a "Watch Together" session.
Logging
Logs are generated to provide insights into the plugin's operations and help identify any issues. Logs include information about the current episode, time left, and any errors encountered during playback synchronization.
Development
Prerequisites
Ensure the plexapi library is installed. You can install it using pip:
bash

pip install plexapi

Testing and Improving User Friendliness
Description
The AutoNextEpisode plugin for Plex Media Server is designed to automatically advance to the next episode during "Watch Together" sessions and keep playback synchronized across all participants. To ensure it works smoothly and is user-friendly, the plugin needs to be thoroughly tested and possibly improved.


Ensure the AutoNextEpisode.bundle directory is correctly placed in your Plex plugin directory.
Set the required environment variables (PLEX_URL, PLEX_TOKEN, CHECK_INTERVAL).
Restart your Plex Media Server.

Playback Monitoring: Verify that the plugin correctly monitors the playback state of the current episode.
Episode Queuing: Confirm that the next episode is queued when there are less than 2 minutes left in the current episode.
Synchronization: Ensure that playback is synchronized across all participants in a "Watch Together" session.
Error Handling: Check the logs for any errors and ensure they are handled gracefully.

User Interface
Configuration Interface: Develop a simple user interface within the Plex web app to allow users to configure the plugin settings (e.g., Plex server URL, token, check interval) without needing to set environment variables.
Status Dashboard: Create a dashboard that displays the current status of the plugin, including active sessions, current episode, time left, and next episode.
Customization Options
Threshold Customization: Allow users to customize the time threshold for queuing the next episode (e.g., less than 2 minutes, less than 5 minutes).
Notification System: Implement a notification system to inform users when the next episode is about to start or if there are any issues detected.
Documentation
Detailed Instructions: Update the README file to include detailed instructions on how to use the new user interface and customization options.
Troubleshooting Guide: Add a troubleshooting guide to help users resolve common issues.
4. Testing the Enhancements
After implementing the enhancements, test the new features to ensure they work as expected.
Conduct usability testing with a few users to gather feedback on the new interface and features.
Summary
The goal is to make the AutoNextEpisode plugin not only functional but also user-friendly. This involves adding a user interface for easy configuration, providing customization options, and enhancing the documentation
